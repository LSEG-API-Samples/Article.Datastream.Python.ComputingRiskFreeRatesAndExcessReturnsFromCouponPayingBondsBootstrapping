Find the [original article on the Refinitiv Developer Portal](https://developers.refinitiv.com/en/article-catalog/article/computing-risk-free-rates-and-excess-returns-part-2-from-sovereign-coupon-paying-bonds-and-bootstrapping-spot-rates-discount-factors).
Our previous article explained what Net Present Values, Face Values, Maturities, Coupons, and risk-free rates are, how to compute them, and how they are used to calculate excess returns using only Zero-Coupon Bonds; in this article, we look at Coupon Paying Bonds, particularly Cash Flow incurred by Coupons, Bootstrapping and particularities about Sovereign Bond data. Very little is changed in this article until the 'Coupon Paying Rate' section. It is aimed at academics from undergraduate level up, and thus will explain all mathematical notations to ensure that there is no confusion and so that anyone - no matter their expertise on the subject - can follow.
